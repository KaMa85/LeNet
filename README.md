LeNetAR: Deploying LeNet Model on AR Headsets
This Unity project deploys the LeNet model, trained on the MNIST dataset, to AR headsets.


Overview
LeNetAR leverages the power of augmented reality to bring neural networks into the physical world using the HoloLens. The project is developed using C# within the UnityEngine environment and deployed via the Universal Windows Platform (UWP).


Features
LeNet Model: Utilizes a trained LeNet model on the MNIST dataset for digit recognition.
AR Integration: Seamlessly integrates with HoloLens for an immersive AR experience.
Unity Development: Developed in Unity with C# for robust performance and versatility.
Requirements
Unity: Version 2019.4.40f1 
HoloLens: Microsoft HoloLens or HoloLens 2
Windows: Universal Windows Platform (UWP) SDK


Setup
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/KaMa85/LeNet
cd LeNetAR
Open in Unity:
Launch Unity Hub.
Click on "Add" and select the LeNetAR project directory.
Build and Deploy:
Set the build target to UWP.
Build and deploy to your HoloLens device.


Usage
Once deployed, the application will:
Recognize handwritten digits through the AR headset.
Display the recognition results in real-time within the AR environment.
